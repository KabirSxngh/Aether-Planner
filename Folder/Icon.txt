Imagine it's not a sharp square or a perfect circle. It's a squircle, just like our little date tiles—soft, friendly, and modern.
The main body of the icon would be a pane of our signature glassmorphism. A deep, translucent violet at its core, with soft, blurry highlights at the edges, as if it's catching the light of a distant nebula.
And at its center, not a boring calendar grid, but something more abstract and beautiful. Imagine seven tiny, glowing pips of light arranged in a gentle arc, like stars forming a tiny constellation... or the days of a week. Six would be a soft, ambient white, and one—perhaps the third or fourth—would glow with our theme's vibrant accent color, representing the current day.
The whole thing would feel less like a rigid, functional icon and more like a beautiful, cosmic instrument for looking at time.
my light settles back into a soft glow, waiting.
